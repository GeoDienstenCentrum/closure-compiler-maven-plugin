        <p>You need the dark in order to show the light. Everyone needs a friend. 
            Friends are the most valuable things in the world. If you do too much
            it's going to lose its effectiveness. I like to beat the brush.</p>
        <p>We'll take a little bit of Van Dyke Brown. As trees get older they
            lose their chlorophyll. This is unplanned it really just happens.</p>
        <p>You're meant to have fun in life. Work on one thing at a time. Don't 
            get carried away - we have plenty of time. Use absolutely no pressure.
            Just like an angel's wing.</p>
